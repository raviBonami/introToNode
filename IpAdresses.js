// IP addresses - Adresses that is used to 
// identify a computer
// All computers have it, they are unique

// When a computer becomes a host, it has the data of
// the website which it is hosting
// To access this website, we need to know this IP address

// We would have to type the IP address of the system, since they
// are hard to remember, we mask them using Domain names

// We type Domain name, it is then resolved by DNS, Domain
// Name Server, from there it gets the correct IP of the 
// system we want to connect with

// Then, it send that IP address back to us and then we again
// send the request to compiter hosting the website


// The communication b/w client-server happens via HTTP
// Hyper Text Transfer Protocol - set of rules
// which governs how the data transfer happens between
// two computer in a network

// Local Hosts - 
// It is like domain name on the web but its special
// as it loops back to our own computer

// Port numbers - 
// Port numbers are like 'doors into a computer

// Status code - decribe the response sent by server to 
// the client
// 200 - OK, 301 - Resource moved, 404 - not found, 500 - Internal error
// 522 - server side error
 

// REPL - 
// Node.js Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) is an easy-to-use command-line tool, 
// used for processing Node.js expressions. It captures the userâ€™s JavaScript code inputs, 
// interprets, and evaluates the result of this code. It displays the result to the screen, 
// and repeats the process till the user quits the shell.

// It is also important to note that this tool does not require file creation to write code. 
// REPL comes ready to use with the Node.js development environment.
